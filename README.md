# Simple Perceptron Implementation

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a simple perceptron model, a fundamental concept in machine learning. The perceptron is a type of artificial neuron that classifies input data into one of two categories using a linear decision boundary.

## Features

- Implements a perceptron from scratch using Python and NumPy.

- Includes a training loop that updates weights based on input data.

- Uses a step activation function to determine class labels.

- Demonstrates perceptron learning through example data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash

pip install numpy

```

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash

jupyter notebook Enhanced_Simple_Perceptron.ipynb

```

2. Run the cells sequentially to train the perceptron.

3. Modify the dataset or learning parameters to experiment with different settings.

- README.md - This file, providing an overview and usage guide.

## Notes

- The perceptron works well for linearly separable data. For more complex problems, consider using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) or other advanced neural network architectures.
