Simple Perceptron Implementation

Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a simple perceptron model, a fundamental concept in machine learning. The perceptron is a type of artificial neuron that classifies input data into one of two categories using a linear decision boundary.

Features

Implements a perceptron from scratch using Python and NumPy.

Includes a training loop that updates weights based on input data.

Uses a step activation function to determine class labels.

Demonstrates perceptron learning through example data.

Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install numpy

How to Use

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Enhanced_Simple_Perceptron.ipynb

Run the cells sequentially to train the perceptron.

Modify the dataset or learning parameters to experiment with different settings.

Notes

The perceptron works well for linearly separable data. For more complex problems, consider using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) or other advanced neural network architectures.
